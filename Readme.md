![Create a Github App](./assets//gh-app-create.png)

1. Set a name for the Github App
1. Set a homepage (the org url is fine for our use case)
1. Disable Webhooks
1. Set permissions ("zero-trust/least privilege" principle) depending on the level of the Self-hosted sharing desired:
   1. Repository :
      1. Actions > Read-Only
      1. Administration > Read & Write
      1. Metadata > Read-Only
   1. Organization :
      1. Repository > Actions > Read-Only
      1. Metadata > Read-only
      1. Self-hosted Runners > Read & write
1. Leave other options as default

Once created :

1. Copy the App ID somewhere you will recall
   ![ghapp-appID](assets/ghapp-appId.png)

1. Select `App Settings` on your GH App details page
   1. If you closed the GH App page, you can retrieve it from `your Organization` > Settings > Github App :

1. Head to the bottom of `your Ghapp` > General page to generate a private key
1. Save the `.pem` file generated
